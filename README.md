# HTML-Portfolio
This is a simple, responsive personal portfolio website built using only HTML. It highlights my background, skills, and projects, and includes multiple sections such as Home, About, and Contact. The goal of this project is to showcase my learning progress in web development and provide a structured way to present myself online.
